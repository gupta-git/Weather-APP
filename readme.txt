1. First start the server. Provide either the IP adress of your computer or the loop back address that exists on every computer which is 127.0.0.1
2. Use any port number about 5000. I recommend using 5050   
3. After the server has started, start the client. 
4. proivide the client with the exact same IP address and port number that you provided the server else the server client communication is useless.
5. As the porgram uses mutli-threading you can create more clients just by opening up new terminal windows. Start these clients just the same way discussed in 4
6. Any client has the power to shut down the server. So once the server has been shut down then the others clients will also shut down after their next command.
